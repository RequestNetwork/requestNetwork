# @requestnetwork/cache-storage

`@requestnetwork/cache-storage` is a package part of the [Request Network protocol](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork).
It is an implementation of the Storage layer of Request Network protocol that uses IPFS to immutably store the data and uses the Ethereum network to persist the IPFS hash of the data and make them permanently available to everyone.

To use Infura to connect to an Ethereum node, get an infura token on [infura.io](infura.io) and
use as provider `"NETWORK_YOU_WANT.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_TOKEN"`.
