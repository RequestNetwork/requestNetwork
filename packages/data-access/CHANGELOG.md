### Bug Fixes

* Data access synchronization not parallelized ([#333](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/issues/333)) ([cd63a22](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/commit/cd63a22))
* Error block XXX not found ([#306](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/issues/306)) ([6c9c59b](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/commit/6c9c59b))


### Features

* add getChannelByTopic in data-access ([#305](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/issues/305)) ([b345df8](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/commit/b345df8))
* add IPFS peer for faster IPFS retrieval, and check IPFS and Ethereum nodes connections ([#353](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/issues/353)) ([47358c2](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork/commit/47358c2))
