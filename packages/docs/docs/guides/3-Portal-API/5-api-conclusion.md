Request API is an abstraction over the Request Network for easy, but centralized, access. It's the fastest way to get started and integrate Request to your product.

## Pros
* Simple REST API, familiar for classic web developers
* No key management
* Faster response time
* Notifications on new requests and received payments
* Send requests to other API users based on their email, instead of their ETH address.
* Easy to build applications on top of Request (see [here](./3-api-apps.md))
* Easy choice between fully public data or encrypted data on the network 

## Cons
* Not fully decentralized
* Users need a Request account to connect
* Encryption is not end-to-end (see [here](./4-api-encryption.md))
