# Request Price Aggregator Subgraph Introduction

Request has a GraphQL API Endpoint hosted by [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/docs/about/introduction#what-the-graph-is) called a subgraph for indexing and organizing data from the Request smart contracts.

Request leverages the [Graph Protocol](https://thegraph.com) to simplify the process of making meaningful applications using the Request Smart Contracts and associated data.

The Graph Protocol provides an accessible GraphQL service providing useful aggregate Request data from the Ethereum blockchain. The links below provide a rudimentary tool to build and test your queries.
