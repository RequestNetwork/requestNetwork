# Introduction

Now you should be comfortable with features of the Request network.

In this guide we will guide through the installation of Request node.

## What is it?

Request Nodes are HTTP servers used to allow clients to communicate with the Request Protocol, these servers abstract the complexity of IPFS and Ethereum for the users. The clients can perform all actions on requets by sending messages to the Node via HTTP.

## Why hosting your own node?

Hosting your node is the most decentralized setup possible. It allows you to:
* Be technically independent in your usage of the network
* Customize your broadcasting latency TODO:check with Vincent the wording for avoiding retention
* Customize storage options

This option is for advanced developers who are already at ease with Ethereum, IPFS and Request.
