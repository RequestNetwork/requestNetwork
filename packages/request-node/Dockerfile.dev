## Warning! This Docker config is meant to be used for development and debugging, not in prod.
## This is a simplified Dockerfile for a fast build
## It expects that the monorepo is compiled (`yarn build:tsc` at the monorepo root)
## And that the request-node is built with NCC: `npx @vercel/ncc build src/server.ts -o dist/ncc`

WORKDIR /request-node
COPY dist/ncc .

# Port configuration
ENV PORT 3000
EXPOSE 3000

# Run
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
