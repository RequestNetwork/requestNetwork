6 ESLint rules behave differently from their TSLint counterparts:
  * no-invalid-this:
    - Functions in methods will no longer be ignored.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-expressions:
    - The TSLint optional config "allow-new" is the default ESLint behavior and will no longer be ignored.
  * prefer-arrow/prefer-arrow-functions:
    - ESLint does not support allowing standalone function declarations.
    - ESLint does not support allowing named functions defined with the function keyword.
  * eqeqeq:
    - Option "smart" allows for comparing two literal values, evaluating the value of typeof and null comparisons.
  * no-underscore-dangle:
    - Leading and trailing underscores (_) on identifiers will now be ignored.
  * @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars:
    - Please read the following article as the rule behaviour may change on the short term: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/1856
