# @requestnetwork/smart-contracs

`@requestnetwork/smart-contracts` is a package part of the [Request Network protocol](https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork).
The package stores the sources and artifacts of the smart contracts deployed on Ethereum. It also exposes a library to get information about the artifacts.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @requestnetwork/smart-contracts
```

You may need some environment variables.
You can create a .env file at the root of this package:

```
DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY=...  # Mandatory to deploy on live blockchains
WEB3_PROVIDER_URL=...       # Mandatory to interact with live blockchains
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=...       # Only used to verify smart contracts code on live blockchains, even for other explorers
ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS=...    # Mandatory to deploy contracts with admin tasks (e.g. ChainlinkConversionPath)
```

## Usage

Library usage:

```js
import * as SmartContracts from '@requestnetwork/smart-contracts';
import { erc20FeeProxyArtifact } from '@requestnetwork/smart-contracts';
import { providers } from 'ethers';

const requestHashStorageMainnetAddress = SmartContracts.requestHashStorageArtifact.getAddress(
  'mainnet',
);

const requestHashSubmitterRinkebyAddress = SmartContracts.requestHashSubmitterArtifact.getAddress(
  'rinkeby',
);

const requestHashStorageABI = SmartContracts.requestHashStorageArtifact.getContractAbi();

const erc20FeeProxyInstance = erc20FeeProxyArtifact.connect(
  // network.name
  'private',
  // RPC Provider or Signer
  new providers.JsonRpcProvider(),
);
```

## Smart Contracts

The package stores the following smart contracts:

**Smart contracts for ethereum-storage package**

- `RequestHashStorage` allows to declare a hash `NewHash(hash, submitter, feesParameters)`. Only a whitelisted contract can declare hashes.
- `RequestOpenHashSubmitter` entry point to add hashes in `RequestHashStorage`. It gives the rules to get the right to submit hashes and collect the fees. This contract must be whitelisted in `RequestHashStorage`. The only condition for adding hash is to pay the fees.
- `StorageFeeCollector` parent contract (not deployed) of `RequestOpenHashSubmitter`, computes the fees and send them to the burner.

**Smart contracts for advanced-logic package**

- `TestERC20` minimal erc20 token used for tests.
- `ERC20Proxy` used to pay requests with an ERC20 proxy contract payment network
- `EthereumProxy` used to pay requests in blockchain native tokens such as ETH on mainnet
- `ERC20FeeProxy` used to pay requests in ERC20 with a fee for the builder [cf. the payment network ERC20 with fee]('../advanced-logic/specs/payment-network-erc20-fee-proxy-contract-0.1.0.md')
- `ERC20ConversionProxy` used to process a payment in ERC20 for an amount fixed in fiat, relying on `ERC20FeeProxy`, [cf. the payment network any-to-erc20](../advanced-logic/specs/payment-network-erc20-fee-proxy-contract-0.1.0.md)

**Smart contracts for payments with swaps**

- `ERC20SwapToPay` same as `ERC20FeeProxy` but allowing the payer to swap another token before paying
- `ERC20SwapToConversion` same as `ERC20ConversionProxy` but allowing the payer to swap another token before paying

## Smart contracts deployment

### Local deployment

The smart contracts can be deployed locally with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RequestNetwork/requestNetwork.git
cd requestNetwork/packages/smart-contracts
# Install packages
yarn install
# Compile smart contracts, generate types and build the library
yarn build
# Run an instance of Ganache, ready for testing
yarn ganache
```

And in another terminal, deploy the smart contracts locally with:

```bash
yarn run deploy
```

### Live deployment (Payment only)

The goal of this script is to let all our payment contracts be deployed with the same sequence on every chain.

The script also verify deployed contracts.

**Be sure that artifacts are up-to-date with most recent deployments**

Environment variables needed: `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY`, `ADMIN_WALLET_ADDRESS`, `DEPLOYMENT_PRIVATE_KEY`

```bash
# First check what will be done
yarn hardhat deploy-live-payments --network matic --dry-run

# Run
yarn hardhat deploy-live-payments --network matic

# To test locally
yarn hardhat deploy-live-payments --network private --force
yarn hardhat deploy-live-payments --network private --force --dry-run
```

### Payment preparation (Beta)

**FIXME: only configured for rinkeby and private networks.**

Environment variables needed: `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`

```bash
yarn hardhat prepare-live-payments --network private
```

### Tests

After a local deployment:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Configuration

Networks and providers are configured in [hardhat.config.ts](hardhat.config.ts).

Have a look at the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/config/).

## Contract verification with Hardhat

Verify and publish the contract code automatically to blockchain explorers, right after smart contracts compilation. You should first set the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` environment variable.

```bash
yarn hardhat verify --network NETWORK_NAME DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
```
