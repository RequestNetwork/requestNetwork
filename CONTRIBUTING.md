# Request Network Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions from anyone, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

## Got a Question or Problem?

For quick help, join the [Request Discord](https://request.network/discord/) and ask your question there.
You will get a reply much faster than by opening an issue.

## Found a Bug?

If you have found a bug, please submit an issue to report it. Or even better, create a pull request!

## Requesting a feature

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue or Discussion() explaining the use case.
If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and
the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

To ensure fast resolution, please include the useful details:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can. Ideally, provide a minimal reproduce scenario through any online javascript code playground.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a github issue before making a change.

We use trunk-based branch strategy: `master` branch represents the most recent released (published on npm) version.

Internal contributors should create a branch from `master` and submit a PR to `master`.
External contributors should create a fork of the repository and submit a PR to `master`.

Please name your PR with the following convention: `feat: <description>` or `fix: <description>` or `chore: <description>`.
The description should be a short summary of the changes in the PR.

Please include the following in your PR:

- A [magic link](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) to the issue that it fixes (if there is one)
- A quick summary and/or background

Feel free to create a "Draft" PR as early as possible to get feedback on your work.
Then, when you are ready for review, mark it as "Ready for review" and request a review from one of the maintainers.

All PRs must pass the CI checks before being merged.
