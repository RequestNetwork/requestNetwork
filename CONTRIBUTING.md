# Request Network Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions from anyone, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

## Got a Question or Problem?

For quick help, join the [Request Discord](https://request.network/discord/) and ask your question there.
You will get a reply much faster than by opening an issue.

## Found a Bug?

If you have found a bug, please submit an issue to report it. Or even better, create a pull request!

## Requesting a feature

You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository explaining the use case.
If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.

## Submission Guidelines

### Submitting an Issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and
the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

To ensure fast resolution, please include the useful details:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can. Ideally, provide a minimal reproduce scenario through any online javascript code playground.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via a github issue before making a change.

We have two main branches: `master` and `development`.
`master` represents the most recent released (published on npm) version.
`development` represents the development state and is a default branch to which you will submit a PR.
We use this structure so that we can push hotfixes to the currently released version without needing to publish all
the changes made towards the next release.
If a hotfix is implemented on `master`, it is back-ported to `development`.

### Useful information when developping
